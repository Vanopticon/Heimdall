## Overview

**Heimdall** is the all-seeing eye and guardian of the entrances to Asgard. In the Vanopticon suite, Heimdall is the central data ingestion and processing hub, enabling secure, robust, and scalable cyber threat defense operations.

Heimdall collects, normalizes, and processes data from diverse sources, providing a unified pipeline for threat intelligence, analytics, and operational visibility.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Data Ingestion:** Aggregates data from multiple sources (logs, sensors, APIs, etc.)
- **Scalable Processing:** Modular architecture for high-throughput, low-latency data handling
- **Security-First Design:** Implements OWASP ASVS controls and secure coding best practices
- **Extensible Pipelines:** Supports custom enrichment, filtering, and transformation modules
- **Integration Ready:** Works seamlessly with other Vanopticon components and common CTD tools
- **Robust Error Handling:** Ensures reliability and maintainability in production environments
